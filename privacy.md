# Privacy Policy — Irish Palo
**Effective date:** 2025-09-02  
**Contact:** irish.palo@gmail.com

This Privacy Policy explains how **Irish Palo** (“we”, “us”, “our”) processes information when you use our ChatGPT Action (“the Action”). The Action is intended for both consumers and businesses and is not for users under 16.

## 1) What the Action does
The Action sends your prompts (and any files you choose to include) to third-party AI services to generate responses. We aim to minimise what we collect and store.

## 2) Personal data we process
- **Content you provide:** prompts, questions, and any text you submit via the Action.  
- **Usage metadata (minimal):** timestamps, request IDs, and basic technical logs needed to operate and troubleshoot the Action.  
- **No user accounts:** we do not create or manage user accounts for this Action.  
- **No payments via this Action.**

**Sensitive data:** Please do not include special-category or sensitive information (e.g., health, financial account numbers, government IDs, precise location) in prompts.

## 3) Sources
- Directly from you when you use the Action.  
- From service providers who help us run the Action (see “Processors”).

## 4) Purposes and legal bases
- Provide and operate the Action (contract/legitimate interests).  
- Troubleshoot, secure, and improve the Action (legitimate interests).  
- Legal compliance where required (legal obligation).  
- No marketing is performed from Action data.

## 5) Processors (service providers)
- **LLM provider:** OpenAI, LLC (processing of prompts/outputs to generate results).  
- **Hosting for this policy page or site:** Google (Google Docs/Drive) or GitHub Pages.  
- **Analytics:** none by default.

We require processors to protect your data and to use it only to provide their services to us.

## 6) International transfers
If you are in the EU/UK/ZA, your data may be transferred to countries outside your region (e.g., the United States) for processing by our providers. We rely on appropriate safeguards such as Standard Contractual Clauses or provider data protection addenda.

## 7) Retention
- **Prompts/outputs:** we do not persist prompts or outputs on our own servers. Providers may retain limited data per their policies to run and protect the service.  
- **Operational logs:** minimal logs kept for **30 days** for security and troubleshooting, then deleted or aggregated.  
- **Backups:** none for Action data.

## 8) Security
We use industry-standard measures such as encryption in transit (HTTPS) and least-privilege access. No method is 100% secure, but we work to protect your information.

## 9) Your rights
Depending on your location (EU/UK GDPR, South Africa POPIA, California CPRA), you may have rights to access, correct, delete, port, or object to certain processing.  
To exercise your rights, email **irish.palo@gmail.com**. We will verify and respond within applicable timeframes.

## 10) Children
The Action is not intended for users under 16. We do not knowingly process data from children in that age group.

## 11) Cookies & tracking
The Action itself does not use analytics or advertising cookies. If you view this policy page on the web, the hosting platform may set strictly necessary cookies.

## 12) “Sale” or “Sharing” (US—CPRA)
We do not sell personal information and do not share it for cross-context behavioural advertising.

## 13) Changes to this policy
We may update this policy from time to time. We will post the updated version here with a new Effective date.
